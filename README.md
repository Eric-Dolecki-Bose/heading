A test project for user - zone detection (distance and gaze angle) - for modified use with a Bose AR scheme. Meaning that this project does not transfer directly to Bose AR use - it must be modified to take in gameRotation for the user's gaze direction (angle of rotation). This also assumes that the user node can be located and updated (moved) around via some mechanism (such as iBeacon triangulation). This proves out distance from user to zone, and viewing angle and angle between two points. This would be quite useful in a loop of zones.
